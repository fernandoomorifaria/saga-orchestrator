# event-driven

## Running

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Give it 15 seconds for all services to start
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"CustomerId": 1, "ProductId": 1, "Amount": 8.50}' \
  http://localhost:5000/order
```

### Checking order status

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/order/<order-id>
```


## Notes

I know, I know, sending `Amount` isn't a good idea because the user can change it, but this is just for the sake of learning.
